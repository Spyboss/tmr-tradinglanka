2. **Developers joining a feature** can review [local development](./setup/local-development.md) and then dive into the [API reference](./architecture/api-reference.md) and [data model](./architecture/data-model.md).
3. **Operators** should keep [deployment](./setup/deployment.md), [environment variables](./setup/environment.md), and [observability](./operations/observability.md) close at hand.
